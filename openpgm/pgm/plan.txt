pgmdump
-------

View all packets like tcpdump, but updated to full spec and allow dump of payload.


pgmmon
------

Dump realtime packet statistics in a ncurses display.



basic_send
----------

Send an ODATA packet and terminate.

Accept string payload and network parameters on command line.

Send to multicast or send to unicast AFI.

IPv4/6.

Define optional session start, finish, late join (?) tags.


spm_idle
--------

Idle in an event loop sending out SPM packets.


stream_send
-----------

Send a constant stream of ODATA and SPM packets.


basic_http
----------

Simple embedded web server


basic_recv
----------

Listen to packets indicating data loss, view details through web interface.


stream_send2
------------

Respond to NAK's with RDATA.


basic_recv2
-----------

Listen to packets and send NAK's to rebuild data.


stream_send3
------------

Send ODATA with FEC.


basic_recv3
-----------

Listen to packets and repair with FEC data.



Scenarios to reproduce
**********************

- Packet loss in stream causing NAK generation.
- Link saturation in sending causing API feedback.
- Link peak stable speed.
- Maxium NAK generation to determine NCF/RDATA throughput.
- Corrupt packets with invalid IP checksum (? generate IP HDR in sender)
- Corrupt packets with invalid PGM checksum.
- Invalid packet values.
- NAK to NCF latency.
- NAK to RDATA latency.
- Publish bandwidth: total, per packet type, payload, per recipient (?)
- Subscribe bandwidth: total, per packet type, payload, per publisher (?)
