--------------------

Send APDUs over ODATA with FEC.


block_recv_with_fec
--------------------

Listen to packets and repair with FEC data.



Scenarios to reproduce
**********************

- Packet loss in stream causing NAK generation.
- Link saturation in sending causing API feedback.
- Link peak stable speed.
- Maxium NAK generation to determine NCF/RDATA throughput.
- Corrupt packets with invalid IP checksum (? generate IP HDR in sender)
- Corrupt packets with invalid PGM checksum.
- Invalid packet values.
- NAK to NCF latency.
- NAK to RDATA latency.
- Publish bandwidth: total, per packet type, payload, per recipient (?)
- Subscribe bandwidth: total, per packet type, payload, per publisher (?)
- Restarting a session with similar or dissimilar sequence numbering.

Outstanding questions
*********************

- Is it faster to use chunks containing multiple packets instead of one MTU
  per packet.  Does aligning with system page size matter?
- Can g_timers be dropped easily for gettimeofday and avoid floating point math?  Possible
  to pass timer upstream with contiguous data for easy access.
- Can time evaluation be dropped to at most once per main loop event?
- Does code work 32 bit and is it optimal?
- Should trash stacks be monitored and controlled externally?  For example, clearing
  up after bursts or administrative control.
- Should trash stacks have a upper limit to then free to the slice allocator?
- Should lost packets be managed as ranges or individual sequence numbers, how
  does each method affect performance?
- Are place holders necessary?  Can state timeouts be managed without a per sequence number
  object?  For example by the next data object, or an extra object for an ncf extended window:
  note that nak packet generation should easily dwarfs time spent unless advantage is taken
  of the additional 62 naks in a opt_nak_list.  Caution has to be taken with the cost of 
  splitting a range when a packet is inserted in the middle, although idealy it should
  be sequential from the trailing edge.
- Is it better to have send sockets per transport, or shared, bound to each interface?

Basic TODO list
***************

- Transport throttling, fine grain throttling.
- OPT_SYN on sending.
- SPMR on receiving.
- Shared trash stacks between multiple receive windows.
- APDUs.
- FEC.
- Heartbeat SPMs :v
- NAK backoff learning.
