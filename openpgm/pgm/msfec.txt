FEC parameters for Microsoft's PGM stack


FECBlockSize (n) [FECGroupSize+1, 255]
Maximum number of packets that can be sent for any group, including original data and parity packets. Maximum and default value is 255.

FECProActivePackets
Number of packets to send proactively with each group. Use this option when the network is dispersed, and upstream NAK requests are expensive.

FECGroupSize (k) [2, 128]
Number of packets to be treated as one group for the purpose of computing parity packets. Group size must be a power of two. In lossy networks, keep the group size relatively small.

fFECOnDemandParityEnabled
Specifies whether the sender is enabled for sending parity repair packets. When TRUE, receivers should only request parity repair packets.
